# VanDerPolOscillator
Coursework project for 2nd year Maths with Computing Bsc. degree
This coursework was part of the problem solving module.

The basic problem given to me that I had to solve was:
 Solving a 2nd order ODE with 3 numerical methods that I was provided with. 
 Creating an app with a user interface where the user should be able to enter a certain number of initial conditions.
 Creating buttons in the UI for the respective numerical methods.
 An output field showing the solution.
 
The final app is written in Java and JavaFX. 
Let me know if you would like to have more background information about the project if you're interested.
